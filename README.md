# Player Advertisements

### <co>Entry for Modtober 2025 : What The heck!?</c>

<cp>You love Advertisements, right?</c> Who doesn't! Maybe you want to <cb>self-promote your own levels</c> with over the top, eye catching, MrBeast clickbaiting advertisements! Or maybe you just want to see some funny ads while you play! <cy>Either way, this mod is for everyone!</c>

This mod adds advertisements everywhere in the game! Every part of the game you go to, you will see an advertisement banner. These banners are clickable, and will take you to the advertisement's level when clicked!

### <cl>Do you want to submit your own advertisement? You can at [GD Advertisement Manager](https://ads.arcticwoof.xyz)</c>
